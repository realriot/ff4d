'''FUSE Filesystem 4 Dropbox''' is a FUSE plugin whichs allows a local mount of your
global Dropbox or jailed application folder.

To improve the browsing experience of your Dropbox content this plugin will cache
the structure for a certain amount of time. There's still some work to do to improve
the caching routine.

=== Requirements ===
There are some requirements which have to be fulfilled to make this plugin work.
* FUSE has to be installed (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/).
* Python pkg-resources must be installed. 
* The user must have the permission to mount FUSE filesystems. On debian systems the user must belong to the group "fuse".
 adduser <user> fuse

=== Authorize access ===
Running '''FF4D''' for the first time without providing an access token, the script will guide you through a
authorization process where you can choose which permission you'll grant to this application.

You'll be advised to go to [https://tools.schmidt.ps/authApp] and enter the code, which this application
gave to you.

''As an alternative'' you can use the enclosed '''./getDropboxAccessToken.py''' script to fetch
the token. But remember for this case that you have to add an Dropbox application within
the [https://www.dropbox.com/developers Dropbox Developer home] by yourself, too.

'''Please secure you access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''

=== Usage ===
To use this FUSE plugin you just have to install fuse and this plugin.
The start is really simple:

 ./ff4d.py <mount folder> [acesstoken]

The accesstoken can optionally supplied via commandline. Normaly the plugin will ask you just one time
and saves it to a configuration file.

Greets and have fun with this little goodie...
